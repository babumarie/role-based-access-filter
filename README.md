# Role-Based Access Filter

A foundational framework for implementing role-based access control (RBAC) with content filtering capabilities, designed for secure multi-agent systems and enterprise data governance applications.

## Project Overview

This project establishes the core infrastructure for role-based content filtering, addressing critical security requirements in distributed systems where different user roles require varying levels of access to sensitive information. The framework provides policy-driven content redaction and validation mechanisms essential for secure information sharing environments.

**Academic Relevance**: Demonstrates understanding of access control theory, security policy implementation, and system design principles fundamental to cybersecurity research and distributed systems engineering.

## Core Features

**Policy-Driven Architecture**: Configurable role definitions with granular access control specifications

**Dynamic Content Filtering**: Real-time content redaction based on user role and policy constraints

**Policy Validation**: Robust policy structure validation ensuring system integrity

**Extensible Framework**: Modular design supporting complex access control scenarios

**Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing suite validating security enforcement mechanisms

## Technical Architecture

### Access Control Engine

The system implements a policy-based access control model where:

- **Policies** define role-specific access permissions and content filtering rules
- **Content Processing** applies contextual redaction based on user roles and policy constraints
- **Validation Layer** ensures policy integrity and prevents misconfigurations

### Security Model

```
User Request → Policy Lookup → Content Filter → Redacted Output
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Role Identity → Access Rules → Filter Logic → Secure Content
```

### Core Components

**Policy Engine**: Manages role definitions and access permissions with validation
**Content Filter**: Processes messages according to role-based redaction policies  
**Validation System**: Ensures policy correctness and security constraint enforcement

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/babumarie/role-based-access-filter.git
cd role-based-access-filter

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Policy Implementation

```python
from src.access_filter import apply_policy, validate_policy

# Define role-based policy
policy = {
    "roles": {
        "admin": {
            "allowed_entities": ["users", "systems", "logs"]
        },
        "user": {
            "allowed_entities": ["public_data"]
        }
    }
}

# Validate policy structure
validate_policy(policy)

# Apply content filtering
message = {"content": "System alert from 192.168.0.1 for user John Smith"}
filtered_content = apply_policy(message, "user", policy)
print(filtered_content)
# Output: "System alert from [IP_REDACTED] for user [USER_REDACTED]"
```

### Testing the Framework

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage analysis
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```
